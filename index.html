            <h4>Computer Science Student</h4>
            <p> I am a dedicated and aspiring computer science student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science Honours
                in Computer Science with a specialization in Software Engineering at the University of Windsor.
                Proficient in a range of programming languages, including Java, C, and Python, I have a strong
                foundation in both software development and system programming. Additionally, I have experience with
                frameworks such as Java3D, Django, and Jenkins, as well as web development technologies like HTML and
                CSS.

                In my academic journey, I have been actively engaged in various projects and coursework, including
                creating interactive games using Java and Java3D. I have also taken on leadership roles as a Scrum
                Master, where I demonstrated effective project management skills and fostered a collaborative team
                environment.

                Outside of academics, I have gained valuable experience as a web design intern, collaborating with a
                team to develop user-friendly websites, and as a team member at Tim Hortons, where I honed my
                communication and teamwork skills in a fast-paced environment.

                Furthermore, my role as a Customer Fulfillment Associate at Walmart has allowed me to improve efficiency
                and organization while ensuring excellent customer service. I have also volunteered for event management
                teams and organizations, further developing my interpersonal and public speaking skills.

                Overall, I am a motivated and adaptable individual with a passion for technology and a strong commitment
                to continuous learning and improvement. I am excited to contribute my skills and knowledge to future
                endeavors in the field of computer science and software engineering.</p>
